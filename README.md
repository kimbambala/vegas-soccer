#### Video Demo:  [<URL HERE>](https://youtu.be/JA0WM9w1aU4)https://youtu.be/JA0WM9w1aU4
#### Description:
A web application that allows anyone who is looking for a pickup soccer game in Las Vegas to find available games on any given day. Developed with Java, Spring Framework, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Vue.js.

Each set of pickup games is designated as a group which has a group name, playing date, starting time, type of game, location name, address, and additional information.

An anonymous user can access the webpage and be able to see the different groups playing today and then be able to browse the page by selecting a specific day of the week. The main display 
is dynamic based on which day you are accessing the page. If you are accessing the webpage on a Sunday for example, the groups listed in the "Playing Today" section will display the groups where the 
playing day is set to Sunday.

To be able to have a group displayed an account needs to be set by registering through the register page. Once a user is registered they are directed to the login page where they can log in with their new username and password. Once logged, they are redirected to the home page showing the groups playing today. Logged-in users will be able to see the hidden page of "My Profile" where they will be able to add, edit, and delete a group.
